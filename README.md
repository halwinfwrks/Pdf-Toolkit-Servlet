# PDF Processor Servlet

**PDF Processor Servlet** is a Java Servlet-based web application designed for processing PDF files with MySQL integration. The project serves as a practical exercise to enhance skills in Java web development, concurrency handling, file operations, and system resource management.

## Key Features

- Merge multiple PDF files into a single document  
- Split a PDF file into multiple parts based on page ranges  
- Convert files (e.g., Word/Image to PDF,...)  
- Store user actions and processing history in a MySQL database  
- Ensure safe concurrent file processing using Java concurrency mechanisms (`synchronized`, thread-safe queues, etc.)

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java Servlet (JSP + Servlet)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **PDF Processing Library**: Apache PDFBox
- **Servlet Container**: Apache Tomcat 10.1.43

## Project Objectives

- Practice building web applications using Java Servlets and JSP  
- Apply concurrency techniques in a multi-user environment  
- Implement file upload/download, session tracking, and database integration  
- Gain a deeper understanding of the servlet lifecycle, thread safety, and resource control

## Learning Use Cases

- A local PDF tool for basic document operations  
- A prototype for document processing in enterprise environments  
- A sandbox for experimenting with servlet-based concurrency techniques

## Setup

Installation and deployment instructions will be provided soon!
